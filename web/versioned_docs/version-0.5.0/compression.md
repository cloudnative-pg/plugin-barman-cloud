# Compression

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0 -->

By default, backups and WAL files are archived **uncompressed**. However, the
Barman Cloud Plugin supports multiple compression algorithms via
`barman-cloud-backup` and `barman-cloud-wal-archive`, allowing you to optimize
for space, speed, or a balance of both.

### Supported Compression Algorithms

- `bzip2`
- `gzip`
- `lz4` (WAL only)
- `snappy`
- `xz` (WAL only)
- `zstd` (WAL only)

Compression settings for base backups and WAL archives are configured
independently. For implementation details, refer to the corresponding API
definitions:

- [`DataBackupConfiguration`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cloudnative-pg/barman-cloud/pkg/api#DataBackupConfiguration)
- [`WALBackupConfiguration`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cloudnative-pg/barman-cloud/pkg/api#WalBackupConfiguration)

:::important
Compression impacts both performance and storage efficiency. Choose the right
algorithm based on your recovery time objectives (RTO), storage capacity, and
network throughput.
